1. Introduction
The AI-Powered Log Analyzer is designed to intelligently classify, analyze, and troubleshoot system logs using hybrid AI techniques. 
It integrates regex-based classification, machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) for adaptive log processing, real-time severity scoring, and automated remediation. This system will improve system stability, detect anomalies early, and provide actionable solutions.

2. Workflow Overview
The workflow follows a structured pipeline with three levels of classification, real-time anomaly detection, and severity-based alerts.

Step 1: Log Message Ingestion
- Logs collected from:
  - journalctl, dmesg, syslog, and other system log sources.
  - Application logs and security logs.
  - Network and kernel logs.
- Log messages are tokenized and preprocessed (removing noise, structuring data).

Step 2: Initial Log Classification (Regex-Based)
- Regex Classification Engine:
  - Uses predefined patterns to match known log types.
  - If a log matches a known category, it is tagged accordingly (Valid Class).
  - If the log is unknown, it proceeds to ML-based classification.

Step 3: AI-Powered Log Classification
If a log message does not match regex-based patterns, it is handled by AI models:

- Enough Training Data Available → Use Fine-Tuned BERT Model  
  - Fine-tuned BERT-based classifiers trained on structured logs.  
  - Identifies categories such as hardware failure, network issues, kernel crashes, security breaches.  

- Not Enough Training Data → Use LLM-Based Classification  
  - LLLM models classify logs.  
  - Helps detect previously unseen errors that regex and traditional models might miss.  
  - Provides detailed context on errors.

Step 4: Real-Time Anomaly Detection & Severity Ranking
- Anomaly Detection Models Used:
  - Isolation Forest → Detects rare or outlier logs.
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAE) → Learns normal patterns and flags anomalies.
  - LSTM Autoencoders → Detects sequential anomalies in time-series logs.
  - DBSCAN → Clusters frequent errors to detect common issues.
  - Hybrid Score Fusion → Combines the outputs of these models for better accuracy.

- Severity Scoring Algorithm:
  - Uses anomaly detection scores + historical frequency analysis.

Step 5: Automated Troubleshooting & Adaptive Learning
- Troubleshooting Engine:
  - If an issue is detected, the system suggests recommended fixes.
  - Uses Bash scripts, systemctl commands, and LLM-generated fixes.
  - Examples:
    - Restart crashed services.
    - Reload drivers for hardware issues.
    - Apply kernel patches if available.

- Adaptive Learning System:
  - Retrains the regex model when new patterns emerge.
  - Updates ML models periodically with newly detected issues.

Step 6: Alerting & Reporting System
- Real-Time Alerts:
  - GNOME popups, CLI warnings.
  - Sends alerts with error descriptions, severity levels, and suggested fixes.

- Dashboard & Reports:
  - Visualizations of log trends, anomalies, and system performance.
  - Provides administrators with insights on recurrent issues and mitigation plans.
