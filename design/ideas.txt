 AI Log Analyzer Design Document

 Author: Rohan

 Overview:

I am a student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and am passionate about learning and contributing to open-source projects. Everything I am about to present here is based on my independent research from online resources. I am eager to refine and redirect my efforts based on feedback and guidance, and I just need an opportunity to prove myself.

While I am relatively new to Machine Learning and open-source development, I am learning quickly and have made significant progress in the last few weeks. I am eager to apply my skills to real-world problems and contribute to the Fedora community.

As a Fedora user for the past year, I have encountered common issues such as Bluetooth disconnections, fingerprint scanner failures, slow application launches, and theme inconsistencies. I want to design this model to troubleshoot these minor but daily-life-impacting bugs automatically.

The goal of the AI Log Analyzer is to automatically detect and troubleshoot these and other anomalies by analyzing system logs and providing actionable solutions.

This tool aims to assist Fedora users by identifying system-level anomalies (security breaches, crashes, network issues, etc.) and providing remediation steps. The project is user-centric, targeting real-world issues Fedora users face daily, with potential for modular expansion to other Linux distributions.

Project Workflow:

1. Log Collection:
   - Source logs from journalctl, dmesg, system logs, and other Fedora logging tools.
   - Fetch logs related to kernel events, user sessions, network activities, and hardware failures.

2. Preprocessing:
   - Parse and clean the logs using Python (regex, pandas).
   - Normalize log formats, handle missing values, and extract structured information (timestamp, severity, event type, service name).
   - Use NLP techniques like tokenization and embedding to prepare logs for AI models.

3. Anomaly Detection:
   - Train and deploy a combination of models:
     - Isolation Forest- for less dense anomalies (e.g., occasional hardware failures, one-off crashes).
     - Autoencoders- for pattern reconstruction.
     - Variational Autoencoders (VAE)- for probabilistic anomalies.
     - LSTM-based Autoencoders - for sequential dependencies in time-series logs.
     - DBSCAN - for dense anomalies (e.g., repeated network failures, frequent authentication errors).

4. AI Inference & Scoring:
   - Score each log entry and event.
   - Mark events with anomaly scores above thresholds as incidents.

5. Troubleshooting Engine:
   - Map detected anomalies to suggested solutions.
   - Automate common fixes like restarting services, reloading drivers, or clearing corrupted cache.
   - Implement this via bash scripts or systemd service calls.

6. Output Layer:
   - Generate human-readable reports.
   - Provide real-time notifications (e.g., system tray popups or command-line alerts).
   - Allow integration with Fedora's GNOME desktop for GUI-based troubleshooting tips.

 AI/ML Models Planned:

 For less dense anomalies:
- Isolation Forest
  - Efficient for sparse, high-dimensional logs.

 For dense anomalies:
- Autoencoders
  - Detect unusual patterns by reconstructing logs.

- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):
  - Capture deeper data distributions.

- LSTM-based Autoencoders:
  - Handle sequential log data effectively.

- DBSCAN:
  - Unsupervised clustering to detect outliers in highly repetitive or correlated logs.

 Notes on Anomaly Density:
- Less dense anomalies: Rare or occasional irregularities such as a one-time Bluetooth disconnect or an isolated app crash.
- Dense anomalies: Frequently occurring issues like repetitive authentication failures or persistent network drops.

 Tech Stack:

- Python (for data handling, model building, automation)
- scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (for ML modeling)
- pandas, NumPy (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Bash/Shell scripting (for automated troubleshooting)
- System tools: `journalctl`, `dmesg`, `systemctl`
- Fedora Workstation** as the primary OS for testing.

Model Strategy:

We will use pre-existing models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, LSTM-based Autoencoders) and adapt them to Fedora-specific log patterns. The project focuses on tuning and integrating these models into a complete anomaly detection and troubleshooting system.

 Additional Notes:

- The technical direction is based on my research and current learning progress.
- I am committed to contributing and improving based on feedback from the Fedora community.
- I am passionate about solving Fedora user pain points using AI, and I am dedicated to making this project a success.
