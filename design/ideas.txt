Project Workflow:

1. Log Collection:
   - Source logs from journalctl, dmesg, system logs, and other Fedora logging tools.
   - Fetch logs related to kernel events, user sessions, network activities, and hardware failures.

2. Preprocessing:
   - Parse and clean the logs using Python (regex, pandas).
   - Normalize log formats, handle missing values, and extract structured information (timestamp, severity, event type, service name).
   - Use NLP techniques like tokenization and embedding to prepare logs for AI models.

3. Anomaly Detection:
   - Train and deploy a combination of models:
     - Isolation Forest- for less dense anomalies (e.g., occasional hardware failures, one-off crashes).
     - Autoencoders- for pattern reconstruction.
     - Variational Autoencoders (VAE)- for probabilistic anomalies.
     - LSTM-based Autoencoders - for sequential dependencies in time-series logs.
     - DBSCAN - for dense anomalies (e.g., repeated network failures, frequent authentication errors).

4. AI Inference & Scoring:
   - Score each log entry and event.
   - Mark events with anomaly scores above thresholds as incidents.

5. Troubleshooting Engine:
   - Map detected anomalies to suggested solutions.
   - Automate common fixes like restarting services, reloading drivers, or clearing corrupted cache.
   - Implement this via bash scripts or systemd service calls.

6. Output Layer:
   - Generate human-readable reports.
   - Provide real-time notifications (e.g., system tray popups or command-line alerts).
   - Allow integration with Fedora's GNOME desktop for GUI-based troubleshooting tips.

 AI/ML Models Planned:

 For less dense anomalies:
- Isolation Forest
  - Efficient for sparse, high-dimensional logs.

 For dense anomalies:
- Autoencoders
  - Detect unusual patterns by reconstructing logs.

- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):
  - Capture deeper data distributions.

- LSTM-based Autoencoders:
  - Handle sequential log data effectively.

- DBSCAN:
  - Unsupervised clustering to detect outliers in highly repetitive or correlated logs.

 Notes on Anomaly Density:
- Less dense anomalies: Rare or occasional irregularities such as a one-time Bluetooth disconnect or an isolated app crash.
- Dense anomalies: Frequently occurring issues like repetitive authentication failures or persistent network drops.

 Tech Stack:

- Python (for data handling, model building, automation)
- scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (for ML modeling)
- pandas, NumPy (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Bash/Shell scripting (for automated troubleshooting)
- System tools: `journalctl`, `dmesg`, `systemctl`
- Fedora Workstation** as the primary OS for testing.

Model Strategy:

We will use pre-existing models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, LSTM-based Autoencoders) and adapt them to Fedora-specific log patterns. The project focuses on tuning and integrating these models into a complete anomaly detection and troubleshooting system.
