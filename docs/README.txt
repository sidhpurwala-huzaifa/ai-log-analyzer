AI Log Analyzer Design Document

Author: Rohan

1. Introduction:

I am currently a student pursuing specialization in Artificial Intelligence, with a strong interest in open-source projects and community-driven problem solving. This document is the result of my own in-depth research using available online resources. I am open to feedback and eager to adapt my approach based on your suggestions. My goal is to continuously improve and make meaningful contributions to this project.

As a Fedora user for the past year, I have personally faced issues such as Bluetooth disconnections, fingerprint scanner anomalies, slow application launches, and theme inconsistencies. My vision for this project is to create a solution that will autonomously detect and resolve these types of recurring system glitches.

The AI Log Analyzer aims to empower Fedora users by detecting and troubleshooting system-level anomalies through AI-driven log analysis. The ultimate goal is to make Fedora more user-friendly and robust while laying the foundation for future adaptability to other Linux distributions.

2. Proposed Workflow:

2.1 Log Collection:
We will collect logs from key system tools including journalctl, dmesg, and system logs. These logs will encompass kernel events, user sessions, network activities, hardware errors, and more.

2.2 Preprocessing:
Log files will be parsed and cleaned using Python libraries such as regex and pandas. Data will be normalized and missing values will be handled. Structured information like timestamps, event types, and service names will be extracted. We will also leverage NLP techniques such as tokenization and embedding to prepare the data for AI models.

2.3 Anomaly Detection:
To effectively detect irregularities in the logs, we will employ a combination of machine learning models:
- Isolation Forest: Suitable for detecting rare or less dense anomalies such as occasional hardware malfunctions.
- Autoencoders: For pattern reconstruction and identifying deviations.
- Variational Autoencoders (VAE): For probabilistic anomaly detection.
- LSTM-based Autoencoders: To capture sequential patterns in time-series logs.
- DBSCAN: To detect dense anomalies, such as recurring network or authentication failures.

2.4 AI Inference & Scoring:
Each log entry will be assigned an anomaly score based on the model's output. Events with scores surpassing predefined thresholds will be flagged as incidents.

2.5 Troubleshooting Engine:
The flagged anomalies will be mapped to relevant troubleshooting actions. Where applicable, the system will automate fixes like restarting services, reloading device drivers, or clearing corrupted cache using bash scripts or systemd service calls.

2.6 Output Layer:
The system will generate readable reports and real-time notifications (e.g., GNOME desktop popups or terminal alerts) to inform users of detected anomalies and recommended actions.

3. Machine Learning Approach:

For sparse or rare events (less dense anomalies), the Isolation Forest model will be the primary tool.
For frequent or recurring issues (dense anomalies), Autoencoders, VAEs, LSTM-based Autoencoders, and DBSCAN will be utilized.

Less dense anomalies: One-off issues like a random Bluetooth disconnect or a single application crash.
Dense anomalies: Repeated errors like constant network disconnections or persistent service failures.

4. Technology Stack:
- Python (for data handling, model building, automation);
- scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (for ML modeling);
- pandas, NumPy (for data processing);
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization);
- Bash/Shell scripting (for automated troubleshooting tasks);
- System tools: journalctl, dmesg, systemctl;
- Fedora Workstation (as the primary testing environment).

5. Model Deployment Strategy:
Rather than building a custom model from scratch, we will employ pre-existing models and tailor them to fit Fedoraâ€™s unique system log patterns. The emphasis will be on fine-tuning these models and integrating them into a cohesive pipeline.

6. Final Remarks:
This project outline reflects my current understanding and research on AI-driven log analysis. I am fully committed to refining this approach based on community feedback and evolving project needs. I am passionate about utilizing AI to address real-world issues Fedora users face and am enthusiastic about contributing meaningfully to this project.
